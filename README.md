# Assignment 3: Real World Analytics

This repository contains the solutions for **SIT718 Assignment 3**, where I applied linear programming and game theory to optimize beverage production costs, maximize production profits, and analyze a game theory scenario.

## Assignment Overview

### Question 1: Beverage Optimization
The goal of this question was to minimize the production cost of a beverage made by mixing two products, A and B, while satisfying constraints on lime, orange, and mango contents. This was solved using a **linear programming model**.

### Question 2: Maximizing Production Profit
In this question, I formulated a linear programming model to maximize profits from three different seasonal products (Spring, Autumn, and Winter) using materials like Cotton, Wool, and Silk while meeting demand and material proportion constraints.

### Question 3: Game Theory
A parlor game between two players was analyzed using game theory to determine optimal strategies and payoffs. The solution was derived using linear programming models for each player.
